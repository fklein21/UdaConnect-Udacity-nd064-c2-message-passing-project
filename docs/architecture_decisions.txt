Three message passing strategies have been used:

- For the API's handling the connection and persons request, a REST endpoint have been chosen. 
  REST API's are more common, and since this is exposed to the end users (potentially 3rd party users), REST has been chosen for a more 
  convenient experience for other web developers.

- For the location API, a gRPC endpoint is used. Since this handles a lot of traffic from the users' mobile devices, 
  gRPC is a good option due to its efficiency. The location endpoint is also only used by the mobile apps,
  the range of developers who would use this API is smaller.

- Since the location endpoint likely handles a lot of traffic a Kafka queue is used to take some
  stress from the database when the traffic spikes.
